# Weightlifting Scoreboard

To keep the original styling of EasyWL IWF Scoreboard, I need to render raw html file since many tag elements are outdated (Example: colspan, align).
Rendering and injecting jsx to html is not allowed in React so I need to either not use React or [practice some dark magic](https://vhudyma-blog.eu/render-raw-html-in-react/).


An app for keeping weightlifting scores.\
